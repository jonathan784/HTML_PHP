  <h1>About Myself</h1>

  <p>Currently I am a student at the university of Kentucky going on my Senior year. Kentucky has been fun and vary rewarding as a school and creating opportunities. Although COVID-19 has stopped interacting with other students I feel confident that we will return to campus.</p>

<h2>My Hobbies</h2>

<p>I enjoy playing soccer outside with friends and family. I have been playing soccer since I Would remember and it has become almost second nature. Another hobbit of mine that I enjoy is playing video games.</p>
